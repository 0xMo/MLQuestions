# Computer Vision Interview Questions
A collection of technical interview questions for computer vision engineering positions.

#### 1) Given stride S and kernel sizes  for each layer of a (1-dimensional) CNN, create a function to compute the [receptive field](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-receptive-field-in-a-convolutional-neural-network) of a particular node in the network. This is just finding how many input nodes actually connect through to a neuron in a CNN. [[src](https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/7gku4z/technical_interview_questions_in_cv/)]

#### 2) Implement [connected components](http://aishack.in/tutorials/labelling-connected-components-example/) on an image/matrix. [[src](https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/7gku4z/technical_interview_questions_in_cv/)]


#### 3) Implement a sparse matrix class in C++. [[src](https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/7gku4z/technical_interview_questions_in_cv/)]


#### 4) Create a function to compute an [integral image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summed-area_table), and create another function to get area sums from the integral image.[[src](https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/7gku4z/technical_interview_questions_in_cv/)]


#### 5) How would you [remove outliers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_sample_consensus) when trying to estimate a flat plane from noisy samples? [[src](https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/7gku4z/technical_interview_questions_in_cv/)]

#### 6) How does [CBIR](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/publications/2013/arandjelovic13/arandjelovic13.pdf) work? [[src](https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/7gku4z/technical_interview_questions_in_cv/)]

#### 7) How does image registration work? Sparse vs. dense [optical flow](http://www.ncorr.com/download/publications/bakerunify.pdf) and so on. [[src](https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/7gku4z/technical_interview_questions_in_cv/)]

#### 8) Describe how convolution works. What about if your inputs are grayscale vs RGB imagery? What determines the shape of the next layer? [[src](https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/7gku4z/technical_interview_questions_in_cv/)]

#### 9) Talk me through how you would create a 3D model of an object from imagery and depth sensor measurements taken at all angles around the object. [[src](https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/7gku4z/technical_interview_questions_in_cv/)]

#### 10) Implement SQRT(const double & x) without using any special functions, just fundamental arithmetic. [[src](https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/7gku4z/technical_interview_questions_in_cv/)]

#### 11) Reverse a bitstring. [[src](https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/7gku4z/technical_interview_questions_in_cv/)]

#### 12) Implement non maximal suppression as efficiently as you can. [[src](https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/7gku4z/technical_interview_questions_in_cv/)]

#### 13) Reverse a linked list in place. [[src](https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/7gku4z/technical_interview_questions_in_cv/)]

#### 14) What's the trade-off between bias and variance? [[src](http://houseofbots.com/news-detail/2849-4-data-science-and-machine-learning-interview-questions)]

#### 15) What is gradient descent? [[src](http://houseofbots.com/news-detail/2849-4-data-science-and-machine-learning-interview-questions)]

#### 16) Explain over- and under-fitting and how to combat them? [[src](http://houseofbots.com/news-detail/2849-4-data-science-and-machine-learning-interview-questions)]

#### 17) How do you combat the curse of dimensionality? [[src](http://houseofbots.com/news-detail/2849-4-data-science-and-machine-learning-interview-questions)]

#### 18) What is regularization, why do we use it, and give some examples of common methods? [[src](http://houseofbots.com/news-detail/2849-4-data-science-and-machine-learning-interview-questions)]

#### 19) Explain Principal Component Analysis (PCA)? [[src](http://houseofbots.com/news-detail/2849-4-data-science-and-machine-learning-interview-questions)]

#### 20) Why is ReLU better and more often used than Sigmoid in Neural Networks? [[src](http://houseofbots.com/news-detail/2849-4-data-science-and-machine-learning-interview-questions)]
